## MO Transporter Notes
Matter Overdrive Transporter support might be buggy at times. Entered coordinates are not being displayed in the transporter since its api is a buggy mess.

To connect a transporter to your computer, you need to use an adapter.

Before setting the points in IS2, remove all points from the transporter and create only one. Don't change it. After that you can start using it in the program.
